Dusty is a simple HTTP server built on top of [zio](https://github.com/lalinsky/zio) and [llhttp](https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp).
The API is very much inspired by Karl Seguin's [http.zig](https://github.com/karlseguin/http.zig), which is a great project and
I would be happy using that, if I didn't need to run multiple network services inside th same application. This is project is in very early stages, don't use it unless you want to experiment or perhaps even contribute.
